# Beer’s Law Calibration Curve (Python Data Analysis)

This project uses Python to construct a Beer’s Law calibration curve and perform linear regression to determine the linear relationship between absorbance and dye concentration.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Methods
Synthetic calibration data was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and plotted using Matplotlib. A linear regression model was applied using NumPy to estimate the slope (m), intercept (b), and coefficient of determination (R²).

## Results
The model produced a strong linear relationship (R² > 0.99), consistent with Beer’s Law. A high-resolution calibration curve image was generated for reporting.
